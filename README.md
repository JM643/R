R Programming

Welcome to my GitHub project page for the R programming language.  

* The Economics folder includes economic concepts. Analysis is provided on my Linkedin page and/or personal blog.   

* The Economics Daily folder is my attempt at replicating the graphs and charts issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 
The Department of Labor publishes this daily so it serves as practice for me. 
The attachments in each folder contain my R code, an Excel document and all images created within R.
