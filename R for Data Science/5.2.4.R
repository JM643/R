# Exercies 5.2.4

#1. Find all flights that 

#a. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
#b. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
#c. Were operated by United, American, or Delta
#d. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
#e. Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
#f. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
#g. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
#2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
#3. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
#4. Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
